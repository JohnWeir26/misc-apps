I'm Ben and I have a background in tech support, IT, and information systems.

I got started in IT a few years ago because I wanted to work in cybersecurity, which is often part of IT.

I now work in information systems, where I work with databases and grant access to users. When I worked in IT, I helped customers fix computer and network issues, replace hardware, and configure phones, usually by responding to tickets and work tasks.

Some essential skills are understanding of hardware, software, and network, as well as good problem-solving and troubleshooting skills.

I stay updated by reading technology news and using new technology as it emerges. One example of a challenging problem we faced is when the internet went out for an entire department. We troubleshooted everything on our end, and were able to determine that it was a mistake by tier 3.

The most significant challenges are cybersecurity and maintaining and effective balance between real technical solutions, and business interests.

My advice is to learn effective problem solving early on, and to always have an adaptive mindset.

Effective collaboration can be challenging. I would look at the example of DevOps. DevOps combine developers and operations, to seamlessly deploy projects.

My advice is to apply for jobs and get some experience in tier 1 tech support, if required.

As far as certifications, I would recommend CompTIA A+ for IT.

I think some potential career paths and growth opportunities include artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and open source intelligence.
